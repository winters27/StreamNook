// Which platform the app is in, as a quiet readout in the title bar.
//
// The title bar is the only chrome mounted in every view (Home, a category
// drill-down, the player, theater, Compact View), so the answer lives here:
// the platform's mark, how many followed channels are live on it, and a
// chevron, sitting beside the logo. No name in any state: these three logos
// need no caption, and the unified view wears all three of them stacked, which
// says "everything" better than the word did. Earlier versions painted the
// platform's colour along the bar's bottom border, and however dim it was cut it
// still read as decoration; the mark's own colour is the only pigment this
// needs, and text answers the question without decorating anything.
//
// The anchor is a glass PILL (`.titlebar-pill`) with a double chevron. It went
// through a hairline-underline phase — form-field language, on the reasoning
// that its job is to disclose a list rather than to act. The pill puts it back
// in the title bar's own material instead: the bar already carries icon buttons
// on the same radius, so a lone underlined label was the odd one out. The fill
// is a low tint over the bar rather than an opaque plate, and the edge is inset
// light rather than a drawn ring, so it reads as glass and not as a chip.
//
// Hover, focus, or a click opens the choices in a small glass flyout hung
// from the anchor, on the Dynamic Island's spring, so the two share physics
// without sharing a silhouette.
//
// Renders nothing until a second platform's watch support ships, so a
// Twitch-only build is untouched.
