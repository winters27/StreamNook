// How far behind the live edge the playhead is, stated so it does not flicker.
//
// The naive measure, `buffered.end(last) - currentTime`, is a SAWTOOTH. HLS
// appends whole segments, so the buffered end jumps forward by one segment
// (~2 s here, up to targetDuration) and then sits still while `currentTime`
// keeps advancing. The raw number therefore falls for a segment's worth of
// time, jumps back up, and repeats, swinging by the segment duration forever
// on a perfectly healthy stream.
//
// Two things were built on that raw number and both shook:
//
//   * the player's time display flipped between "LIVE" and a timestamp,
//   * the broadcast timeline's playhead slid back and forth by seconds.
//
// The fix is to report the sawtooth's PEAK over a short window. The peak is
// also the honest value: a segment's content was produced roughly one segment
// duration before it appended, so the gap is widest, and truest, right after
// an append. Taking the peak from real buffered samples keeps this grounded in
// what has actually been downloaded. It deliberately does NOT extrapolate the
// edge with wall-clock time: `hls.latency` already does that (it adds playlist
// `age`) and a stale playlist inflates it by a second per second while playback
// is fine, which has produced two wrong diagnoses already. See
// `Brain/references/StreamNook_LL_Latency_Control.md`.
