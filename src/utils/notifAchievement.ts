// state is persisted (to user_accolades via grantAccolade, the same way
// seasonal / cake-day accolades persist), so the medallion and the Midnight
// Atmosphere it unlocks do follow the account.

// Stable id stored in user_accolades.accolade_id and matched by the secret
// accolade (ProfileOverview) and the Midnight Atmosphere's unlock gate. The
// stored value stays 'insomniac' (the original codename) so any already-earned
// grants remain valid; the player-facing label is "Restless".
