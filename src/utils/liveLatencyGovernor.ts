/**
 * Continuous live-latency maintenance, shared by the solo player and MultiNook tiles.
 *
 * hls.js runs here with `lowLatencyMode:false` (the correct setting for Twitch over a
 * proxy: native LL-HLS chunk parsing causes cyclic starvation). A side effect is that
 * hls.js's OWN playback-rate catch-up is gated off, so nothing holds the playhead at
 * the configured cushion after the cold-start snap and latency drifts upward across a
 * session (the "10-20s behind live" bug).
 *
 * This governor restores that maintenance WITHOUT ever seeking (seeking a live hls.js
 * stream toward the edge mid-playback freezes it — a hard-won lesson). It nudges
 * `video.playbackRate` only.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES — the FORWARD BUFFER (`bufferedEnd - currentTime`), NOT the
 * distance to the playlist's live edge. This distinction is load-bearing: on a
 * low-latency channel the relay promotes Twitch's in-progress PREFETCH segments, so
 * hls.js's reported live edge sits ahead of what is actually downloadable. Chasing
 * that edge makes the governor accelerate into the in-progress zone and starve the
 * buffer (constant stalls). The forward buffer is always reachable, so targeting it
 * is safe: the governor speeds up ONLY when there is EXCESS forward buffer (the
 * playhead has fallen behind and there is downloaded content to consume), and that
 * very act shrinks the excess back to the target — it can never drain the buffer
 * below the target, so it cannot cause a stall.
 *
 * User speed control is respected for free: every Plyr speed-up option is >= 1.25
 * (above any sane `ceiling`) and every slow-mo option is < 1.0, so if the current
 * playback rate sits outside (1.0 .. ceiling] the user has taken manual control and
 * the governor stands down until the rate returns to 1.0.
