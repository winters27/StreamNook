/**
 * Keeps `platformAccountStore` current without polling.
 *
 * Mount ONCE per window. Every surface that needs to know whether Kick or
 * YouTube is connected reads the store; none of them checks for itself. That is
 * the whole point — the previous arrangement had one 5-second poll per pane, so
 * a popout with six panes made six IPC calls every five seconds to read two
 * booleans that had not changed since the user last clicked something.
 *
 * Three triggers:
 *  - `platform-account-changed`, emitted by Rust whenever a token is stored or
 *    cleared, including in another window.
 *  - the window becoming visible, which catches anything that happened while it
 *    was hidden.
 *  - a slow backstop poll, below.
 *
 * The backstop matters. The original per-pane 5-second polls were wasteful, but
 * they were also SELF-HEALING: nothing could get permanently stuck, because the
 * next tick fixed it. An event-only design has single points of failure — a
 * listener that attaches after the emit, an emit path someone forgets to add to
 * a new code path, a backend that restarted. Any of those would leave the
 * composer disabled with no way back. So the events do the fast work and a slow
 * poll guarantees convergence.
