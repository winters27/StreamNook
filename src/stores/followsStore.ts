// In-app follows for platforms whose own follow list we can't read.
//
// Twitch follows come from Helix and live in AppStore.followedStreams. Kick and
// TikTok expose no followed-channels API to us, and YouTube's subscriptions are
// only readable while a cookie session exists — so StreamNook keeps its own
// per-platform follow list, persisted by the backend in
// `Settings.provider_follows` (a TYPED Rust field, because the who's-live
// poller reads it too).
//
// Liveness arrives two ways, both feeding `liveByKey`: the backend poller's
// `provider-live-update` event, and an initial `get_provider_followed_live`
// pull at startup. Consumers read the merged view through
// `useUnifiedFollowedLive`.
