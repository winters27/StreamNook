// Synchronous, local snapshot of the signed-in member's Profile -> Overview

// identity caches are wiped on every app restart, so a cold open of the Profile
// pane used to paint a barebones card (no paint, no badges) and then "dress up"
// as each async source resolved a beat later. This persists the last rendered
// loadout to localStorage so the card paints fully-dressed on the next open
// BEFORE any network read; the normal background fetches then revalidate and
// overwrite only what actually changed.
//
// Not a source of truth: 7TV / Twitch / the Identity API stay authoritative, and
// a stale entry self-corrects on the next revalidation. It is written through on
// every change to the rendered cosmetics, so opening the profile after editing a
// loadout always reflects the latest selection.
