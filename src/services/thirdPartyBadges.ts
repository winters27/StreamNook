/**
 * DEPRECATED: This service has been replaced by the unified Rust badge service
 * 
 * Third-party badge functionality (FFZ, Chatterino, Homies) is now handled in Rust
 * for maximum performance. All badges are automatically fetched and cached by the
 * Rust backend.
 * 
 * Please use `badgeService.ts` instead:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import { getAllUserBadges, prefetchThirdPartyBadges } from './badgeService';
 * 
 * // Get all badges (including third-party) for a user
 * const badges = await getAllUserBadges(userId, username, channelId, channelName);
 * console.log(badges.third_party_badges); // FFZ, Chatterino, Homies badges
 * ```
 * 
 * The Rust backend handles:
 * - Global badge database caching (10 minute expiry)
 * - Automatic fetching from FFZ, Chatterino, and Homies APIs
 * - Efficient lookups by user ID
 * - Background pre-fetching on app startup
 */

export {
  getAllUserBadges,
  prefetchThirdPartyBadges,
