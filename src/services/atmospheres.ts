// StreamNook Atmospheres: our own line of profile backdrops. Each one is
// StreamNook IP (a designed gradient scene or a pre-rendered image), so it's
// clean to sell. An Atmosphere themes the profile background AND signs the
// member's chat messages with a matching wash, so the cosmetic follows them
// everywhere they show up.
//
// The catalog is SERVER-DRIVEN: definitions live in the Supabase `atmospheres`
// table and are fetched into an in-memory registry at startup (see
// supabaseService.ts). So a new atmosphere ships as a DB row + an R2 asset, live
// for every client with no desktop release, and a viewer on an older build can
// still render a newer atmosphere. `getAtmosphere` / `listAtmospheres` below just
// read that registry. This file owns only the shared `Atmosphere` shape.
