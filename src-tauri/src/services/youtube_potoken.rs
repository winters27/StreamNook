//! Mints YouTube Proof-of-Origin tokens in an isolated webview.
//!
//! SABR playback is the only transport that carries 1440p/2160p on many live
//! broadcasts, and it refuses any request whose `StreamerContext` lacks a PO
//! token. The token can only be produced by running BotGuard, an obfuscated
//! integrity check that needs a real browser, so this borrows one.
//!
//! **Isolation is the point.** The bundle runs in a hidden window pointed at an
//! EXTERNAL url, which is what keeps Tauri from injecting its API there: the
//! BotGuard interpreter is third-party code fetched at runtime, and it must
//! never execute anywhere it could reach the app's IPC. The only channel back is
//! the URL fragment, which carries a token and nothing else. Same shape as the
//! 7TV token capture in `commands::seventv_cosmetics`.
//!
//! The bundle is built from `potoken/mint.mjs` by `npm run build:potoken`.
