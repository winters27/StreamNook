//! MPEG-TS to fragmented-MP4 transmuxer for the low-latency origin.
//!
//! Why this exists: hls.js demuxes MPEG-TS in JavaScript and rewrites sample
//! timestamps statefully as it appends (each fragment is chained onto the end of
//! the timeline built so far). That makes appends NON-IDEMPOTENT: when hls.js
//! decides to re-fetch a fragment it already buffered, the re-appended video
//! lands AFTER the buffered end (a 2s duplicate insert) while the audio
//! coalesces in place, permanently forking the A/V timelines. Proven live
//! 2026-06-11 (streamdatabase capture): avGap stepped 0 to -14s in seven exact
//! -2s steps, one per whole-fragment re-fetch, with byte-identical part hashes.
//! Serving fMP4 removes that entire failure class: sample timestamps are
//! explicit in the bytes (`tfdt`), the browser places samples by timestamp, and
//! a duplicate append overwrites the same time range. Idempotent by
//! construction, whatever still triggers the re-fetch.
//!
//! Scope: exactly the streams the TS origin sees (Twitch H.264 "chunked"
//! quality: one H.264 video PES stream, access-unit aligned, plus one ADTS AAC
//! audio PES stream). This is not a general-purpose TS demuxer.
//!
//! Timing model: video track timescale is the native 90 kHz PES clock; audio
//! track timescale is the AAC sample rate so every frame is exactly 1024 ticks.
//! 33-bit PES timestamps are unwrapped against the previous value (closest
//! representation wins), so the ~26.5h rollover never folds the timeline. Each
//! fragment carries a 64-bit `tfdt`, which is what makes placement absolute.
//!
//! Mid-stream encoder changes (server-side ad splices, broadcaster
//! reconfigures) are survivable by design: the sample entry is `avc3` with
//! SPS/PPS kept in-band, so the decoder switches parameter sets when the bytes
//! do. And the output is ONE seamless timeline by invariant: every input-clock
//! discontinuity beyond the stream's own frame cadence — splice restarts,
//! encoder gaps, abandoned segment tails — is bridged onto the working cadence
//! (see `SPLICE_TOLERANCE_MIN`), audio riding the same offset for A/V sync.
//! The playlist's declared durations cannot express holes, so an unbridged gap
//! would desync hls.js's playlist arithmetic from the buffer. Only a window
//! rebuild re-baselines instead (its skip IS mirrored in the playlist).
//!
//! Audio `tfdt` follows the running sample count, not each fragment's measured
//! PES PTS. AAC is gapless by construction, but re-deriving a fragment's start
//! from the quantized 90 kHz measurement (through a truncating rescale) lands a
//! few ticks off where the previous fragment ended, and MSE renders every such
//! sub-frame seam as a gap or overwrite at the splice point (audible pop, and
//! a wild measurement can push a sample far enough out of range to error the
//! media element). The measurement only re-anchors the timeline when it
//! disagrees by more than one frame, which is a genuine splice.
