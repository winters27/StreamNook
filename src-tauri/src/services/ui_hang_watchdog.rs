//! UI-thread "Not Responding" detector.
//!
//! "Not Responding" is the Win32 UI thread (the window's message pump) failing to
//! pump messages, NOT a CPU/tokio stall. `runtime_watchdog` measures tokio and
//! whole-process scheduling lag; it cannot see a pump that is wedged while every
//! other thread keeps running, which is the classic shape of a blocking WebView2 /
//! COM call (e.g. native window-occlusion handling when another window covers ours
//! during the Twitch login overlay).
//!
//! This watchdog probes the pump directly, the same way the OS decides whether to
//! paint "(Not Responding)", and records onset/recovery with enough context to name
//! the real cause: what window took the foreground, whether ours was minimized, which
//! Twitch overlay was mounted, and whether process scheduling was still healthy at
//! the time (small self-lag + hung pump == pump wedge, not CPU).
//!
//! The capture path is allocation-free on purpose. A wedged UI thread can be stuck
//! inside an allocation or a COM call that holds the process heap lock; anything on
//! this thread that allocates (format!, String, the log crate, std::fs path joins)
//! would then block on the same lock and the hang would go unrecorded. So a hang is
//! formatted into a fixed stack buffer and written with raw CreateFileW/WriteFile
//! (kernel calls that use kernel pools, not the process heap). The log path is
//! pre-encoded to UTF-16 once at startup, the only heap work this module does.
//!
//! Reports land in the same `logs/errors.log` the crash logger uses, so its presence
//! after a freeze (or its absence) is a signal in itself. A separate `logs/
//! ui_hang_watchdog.armed` marker is written once at startup so an absent errors.log
//! can be read as "started, never hung" rather than "never started / old build".

/// Master switch. On by default: the probe is one message per second and costs
/// nothing until something hangs. Flip to `false` + rebuild to disable.
