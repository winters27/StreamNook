//! Serves YouTube's video-only DASH renditions to hls.js as ordinary HLS.
//!
//! YouTube publishes 1440p and 2160p live only as video-only `adaptiveFormats`
//! itags, delivered as manifestless DASH fragments addressed by `&sq=N`, in
//! WebM. hls.js plays neither WebM nor DASH. Rather than put a second media
//! engine in the frontend, this rewrites the container (`webm_fmp4`) and the
//! packaging, so the player, Plyr chrome and quality menu stay exactly as they
//! are and simply gain rungs.
//!
//! What is served:
//!
//! ```text
//! /stream.m3u8   master: one video variant plus an audio rendition group
//! /video.m3u8    rolling live media playlist, EXT-X-MAP + fMP4 segments
//! /audio.m3u8    the same for audio
//! /init_v.mp4    generated from the WebM track header
//! /init_a.mp4    YouTube's own audio ftyp+moov, split out of a fragment
//! /v/<sq>.m4s    fetched, transmuxed WebM -> fMP4
//! /a/<sq>.m4s    fetched, moof+mdat sliced out of a self-contained fragment
//! ```
//!
//! This is a separate server from `stream_server` on purpose. That relay is the
//! Twitch low-latency path and is load-bearing; nothing here needs its ad
//! detection, segment projection or LL origin, and keeping them apart means a
//! bug in this path cannot reach Twitch playback.
//!
//! Timestamps are passed through absolutely rather than rebased. YouTube gives
//! video (millisecond ticks) and audio (44100 ticks) positions on one shared
//! media timeline, so leaving them alone is what keeps the two tracks in sync
//! without this module having to understand either clock.
