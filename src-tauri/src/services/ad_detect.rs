//! Shared Twitch SSAI ad DETECTION, the single source of truth for the marker
//! strings, so the solo player (`stream_server`) and MultiNook
//! (`multi_nook_server`) recognize ad windows identically.
//!
//! Detection is read-only by design: the core relay is ad-neutral and never
//! edits ads out of the playlists it serves. The state tracked here drives the
//! UI's ad indicator and the `on_ad_window` plugin event, which is how an
//! installed resolution-owning plugin learns it should swap the relay's
//! upstream (docs/plugins/PROTOCOL.md).
//!
//! Markers were confirmed live: an ad pod is a
//! `#EXT-X-DATERANGE CLASS="twitch-stitched-ad"` (id `stitched-ad-...`)
//! carrying `X-TV-TWITCH-AD-*` metadata, or an `#EXTINF` segment whose title
//! contains "Amazon".

/// High-confidence Twitch ad signatures. `stitched-ad` matches both the
/// DATERANGE class (`twitch-stitched-ad`) and the id form (`stitched-ad-…`);

/// discontinuity with the SEPARATE tag `#EXT-X-PREFETCH-DISCONTINUITY`, which hls.js
/// does not understand and silently drops. So a naive promotion (pass the marker

/// Fix: translate `#EXT-X-PREFETCH-DISCONTINUITY` into a real `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY`
/// emitted immediately before the promoted segment it precedes, so the promoted and
/// the eventual finalized form agree on `cc`. We deliberately do NOT touch
/// `#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` (appending hints at the tail gives them the same SN they
/// get when finalized) or `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY-SEQUENCE` (it seeds the cc of the
