## 🎯 The Problem

Let's be honest: you're grinding through your 47th hour of that indie roguelike, talking to yourself about optimal build paths, when you realize—*I need human voices*. But opening Twitch in a browser? That's like inviting a resource-hungry elephant to sit on your CPU. Your fans spin up, your frame rate tanks, and suddenly you're choosing between watching streams and actually playing games.

**StreamNook** is the answer to this very specific but deeply relatable problem.

Built from the ground up with Rust and React, StreamNook delivers a buttery-smooth Twitch experience that sips resources instead of chugging them. It's the cozy corner of the internet where you can watch streams, chat with communities, and track your favorite streamers—all without turning your PC into a space heater.
